## About
Mesil originated from my undergraduate research "Fluorescent-labeled mesoporous silica nanorods (MCM-41) for applications in nanomedicine: synthesis and characterization", in partnership with the National Cancer Institute (INCA). The CLI was motivated by my necessity of repeatedly analyze various data from materials characterization.
